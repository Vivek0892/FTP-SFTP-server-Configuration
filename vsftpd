install and configure vsftp in an instance such that, it can receive files very securely via port 21 to the configured directory as configures user.for Vsftp also privileges are restricted

Os: RHEL 8
Platform: AWS

Package VSFTPD
Configuration /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
VSFTPD, short for Very Secure FTP daemon, is a secure FTP daemon that is an upgrade of FTP protocol. It enforces secure connections to FTP servers by encrypting traffic send to and from the server, and by so doing, the file transfer is kept safe and secure from hackers.

Install vsftpd
$ sudo dnf install vsftpd

Start and Enable vsftpd
 $ sudo systemctl enable –now vsftpd
Create ftp user and its directory
 $ sudo adduser ftpuser
 $ sudo passwd ftpuser
 $ sudo mkdir -p /home/ftpuser/ftp_dir
Assigning Permisiion and Ownership to The Directory
 $ sudo chmod -R 750 /home/ftpuser/ftp_dir
 $ sudo chown -R ftpuser: /home/ftpuser/ftp_dir
Add the FTP user to the /etc/vsftpd/user_list file to allow the user access to the vsftp server.
  $ sudo bash -c 'echo ftpuser >> /etc/vsftpd/user_list
Cinfigure SFTPD via its configuration file
The default configuration file for vsftpd is the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file. The file is replete with directives that help fortify your FTP server’s security
To allow local users to access the FTP server remotely, and block anonymous users
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES

To grant users rights to run any FTP command & make changes such as uploading, downloading and deleting files
write_enable=YES

For security purposes, you may opt to restrict users from accessing any files & directories outside their home directories
chroot_local_user=YES

To grant users write access to their respective home directories
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

define custom ports to enable Passive FTP connections. In this case, we will specify ports 30000 and 31000. We shall later open these on the firewall
pasv_min_port=30000
pasv_max_port=31000

only allow the users defined in the /etc/vsftpd/user_list access to the server and block the rest
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd/user_list
userlist_deny=NO

 restart the Vsftpd service.

 $ sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

To encrypt communications between the server and a client system, we need to generate a TLS certificate and later configure the server to use it.
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.pem

req- is a command for X.509 Certificate Signing Request (CSR) management.
    • x509- means X.509 certificate data management.
    • days- defines number of days certificate is valid for.
    • newkey- specifies certificate key processor.
    • rsa:2048- RSA key processor, will generate a 2048 bit private key.
    • keyout- sets the key storage file.
    • out- sets the certificate storage file.
      
the above command will ask you to answer the questions below:
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]: the ISO 3166-1 two-letter country code for your country. Example: US
    • State or Province Name (full name) []: the state or province name. Example: Massachusetts
    • Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]: the city of the service. Example: Boston
    • Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]: the FTP company name. Example: Example.com
    • Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: The company main area of interest. Example: Information Technology
    • Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []: the hostname required to connect to the FTP server. Example: example.com
    • Email Address []: the admin e-mail address. Example: ftp-admin@example.com
The most important line is the one that requests theCommon Name: we need to enter the domain name associated with our server or our server's public IP address.
Here also need to tell the server where the certificate files are stored. So, head back to the configuration file /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf and specify the path to the certificate files.

rsa_cert_file=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/vsftpd.pem
 instruct the server to turn on SSL.$ sudo firewall-cmd --relo­ad
ssl_enable=YES

restart vsftpd service,
$ sudo systemctl restart vsftpd

If you are running a firewall, you need to allow these salient ports”
20 – to allow FTP traffic
      21 – FTP data port
      30000-31000 – To allow passive communication with the FTP server.

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent –add-port=20-21/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=30000-31000/tcp
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
